You turn on your computer and open your vacaction                                 destination list, and find out your file corrupted :pensive: :(. When it corrupted,                            
It inserted a bunch of weird characters in your list, so now you want to fix your file. For this activity, take out all the **non alphabetic, non single-space** characters in `cities`. Aka, get rid of all the characters in `cities` that are not in `VALID_CHARS`
