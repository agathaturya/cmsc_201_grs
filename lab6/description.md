You were making a list of your dream vacation spots when all of a sudden, _your computer crashed_ :scream:! You turn on your computer and open your vacaction destination list, and find out your file corrupted :pensive:. When it corrupted, it inserted a bunch of weird characters in your list. You want to fix our vacation spots list so you can start planning. For this activity, take out all the **non alphabetic, non single-space** characters in `cities`. Aka, get rid of all the characters in `cities` that are not in `VALID_CHARS`. You will need to use **several** string functions for this activity.
