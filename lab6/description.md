You were making a list of your dream vacation spots in your favorite list app, when all of a sudden, _your computer crashed_ :scream:! You turn on your computer, open your vacaction destination list, and find out your list **_corrupted_** :pensive:. A bunch of weird characters got inserted in your list. You want to fix your vacation spots list :soon:, so you can start planning your trips. The software engineer of this app quit, but luckily left a bunch of comments! For this activity, take out all the **non alphabetic, non single-space** characters in `cities`. Aka, get rid of all the characters in `cities` that are not in `VALID_CHARS`. You will need to use **several** string functions for this activity.
