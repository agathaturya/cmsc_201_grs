# (Linux) Terminal Cheatsheet :sparkles:

### Here are some super useful commands that are **really** helpful to know! Let me know if you find/know of any commands I should add

## Which key is the Meta key?
#### Windows: Alt
#### Mac: **Read Me!!**
**all of this is optional, because you can copy and paste directly in Terminal using `cmd + c`, `cmd + v`, etc., and your mouse/cursor. However, the tabs/spacing might (read: will) get wonky if you use `cmd + c`, `cmd + v`, etc. To avoid that, you can set the Option key as your Meta key**
1. Open Terminal
2. Open Terminal Preferences (` cmd + , `)
3. Go to Profiles :arrow_right: Keyboard :arrow_right: check "Use Option as Meta key"
